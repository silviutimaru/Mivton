<!-- 
ðŸš€ OPTIONAL: Add this single line to your dashboard.html to show the presence widget
Add anywhere in the <body> section, preferably before the closing </body> tag
-->

<script src="/js/presence-widget.js"></script>

<!-- 
That's it! The widget will automatically appear in the top-right corner.
If you want it in a specific location instead, first add a container:

<div id="presence-widget-container"></div>
<script src="/js/presence-widget.js"></script>

The widget will appear in the container instead of floating.
