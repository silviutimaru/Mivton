2. **User A Actions**:
   - Search for User B
   - Send friend request
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Friend request stored in `friend_notifications` table
   - No real-time notification sent (user offline)
   - User A sees confirmation

### Scenario 3: Offline Notification Loading
1. **Setup**: User B has pending offline notifications

   - Each popup shows "üìã Offline" indicator
   - Accept/Decline buttons work correctly
   - Notifications marked as read when dismissed

### Scenario 4: Accept Friend Request
1. **User B Actions**:
   - Click "Accept" on friend request notification
2. **Expected Results**:
   - User A receives "Friend Request Accepted" notification
   - Both users become friends in database
   - Friend counters update for both users
   - Notification marked as read

### Scenario 5: Decline Friend Request
1. **User B Actions**:
   - Click "Decline" on friend request notification
2. **Expected Results**:
   - Friend request marked as declined
   - No notification sent to User A
   - Notification marked as read

## üîß Technical Components

### Backend Implementation
- `routes/friend-requests.js` - Enhanced with real-time notifications
- `routes/offline-notifications.js` - New route for notification management
- `socket/enhanced-friends-events.js` - Real-time Socket.IO events
- Database: `friend_notifications` table for offline storage

### Frontend Implementation
- `public/js/notifications.js` - Complete notification system
- `public/css/notifications.css` - Beautiful notification styling
- `public/dashboard.html` - Updated with notification support

### Key Features
- **Real-time Socket.IO events**: `friend_request_received`, `friend_request_accepted`
- **Offline notification API**: `/api/notifications/unread`, `/api/notifications/:id/read`
- **Sound system**: Different tones for different notification types
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## üéµ Sound System

The notification system includes custom-generated sounds:
- **Friend Request**: Rising tone (800Hz ‚Üí 1000Hz ‚Üí 1200Hz)
- **Friend Accepted**: Falling tone (1200Hz ‚Üí 1000Hz ‚Üí 800Hz)
- **General**: Simple double beep (600Hz ‚Üí 800Hz)

## üì± Notification Features

### Popup Notifications
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds based on notification type
- User avatars with initials
- Action buttons (Accept/Decline/Dismiss)
- Automatic dismissal after 10 seconds
- Offline indicator for stored notifications

### Browser Notifications
- Native browser notifications for important events
- Requests permission automatically
- Auto-closes after 5 seconds

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### friend_notifications Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE friend_notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    sender_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    data JSONB,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    read_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. **Database Migration**: The friend system schema should already be in place
2. **Server Update**: Restart the server to load new routes
3. **Client Cache**: Clear browser cache to load new JavaScript/CSS
4. **Testing**: Use the scenarios above to verify functionality

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Real-Time Connections
- Open browser console
- Look for "‚úÖ Notification socket connected" message
- Verify Socket.IO connection in Network tab

### Verify Database Storage
```sql
-- Check friend requests
SELECT * FROM friend_requests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check offline notifications
SELECT * FROM friend_notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check friendships
SELECT * FROM friendships ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Console Debugging
- All notification events log to console with emojis
- Look for "üì® Friend request received" and similar messages
- Check for any error messages in red

## üéØ Expected Performance

- **Real-time latency**: < 100ms for online users
- **Offline loading**: < 2 seconds for up to 10 notifications
- **Sound playback**: Immediate with Web Audio API
- **Database queries**: Optimized with proper indexes

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The system is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ Online users receive immediate notifications with sound
2. ‚úÖ Offline users see all missed notifications on login
3. ‚úÖ Accept/Decline actions work for both real-time and offline
4. ‚úÖ Database correctly stores and updates all friend relationships
5. ‚úÖ UI is responsive and animations work smoothly
6. ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors in browser console
7. ‚úÖ Socket.IO connection establishes successfully

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No sound**: Check browser audio permissions
2. **No notifications**: Verify Socket.IO connection
3. **Database errors**: Check PostgreSQL connection
4. **UI issues**: Clear browser cache and reload

### Support
If issues persist, check:
- Server logs for backend errors
- Browser console for frontend errors
- Network tab for failed API requests
- Database logs for query issues
