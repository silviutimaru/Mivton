## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **üéØ Identify Correct Production URL**
   - Check deployment documentation for actual production domain
   - Verify if using subdomain (e.g., app.mivton.com, platform.mivton.com)
   - Check if deployed on different domain entirely
   - Review Railway deployment configuration for actual URL

2. **üîç Verify Deployment Status**
   - Confirm if application has been successfully deployed to production
   - Check deployment logs for any URL configuration issues
   - Validate DNS settings and domain routing

3. **üìã Update Testing Documentation**
   - Correct production URL in all testing documentation
   - Update smoke test scripts with verified production endpoint
   - Revise deployment verification procedures

### Production Testing Plan (Once URL Identified)
1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Site availability and loading speed
   - User registration and login flows
   - Core navigation and responsive design

2. **Friends System Validation**
   - Friend request sending/accepting (with test accounts only)
   - Friends list loading and pagination
   - Search functionality

3. **Security and Performance**
   - HTTPS enforcement and security headers
   - API endpoint authentication
   - Load testing with realistic traffic

4. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket connections for live updates
   - Presence system functionality
   - Notification delivery

## Alternative Testing Approaches

### If Production URL Cannot Be Identified
1. **Staging Environment Testing**
   - Request access to staging environment
   - Run full test suite against staging deployment
   - Validate Railway deployment configuration

2. **Local Production Build**
   - Build application in production mode locally
   - Test production optimizations and configurations
   - Validate environment variable configurations

## Next Steps

1. **üîç Domain Investigation** (Priority 1)
   - Contact deployment team/documentation for correct production URL
   - Check Railway dashboard for deployed application URL
   - Review any custom domain configurations

2. **üìù Documentation Update** (Priority 2)
   - Update all references to production URL once identified
   - Revise testing procedures and smoke test scripts
   - Document correct production testing workflow

3. **üß™ Re-run Production Testing** (Priority 3)
   - Execute full smoke test suite against correct URL
   - Validate all core functionality in production environment
   - Generate comprehensive production validation report

## Transportation Site Analysis (Informational)

The current mivton.com appears to be a legitimate business website for:
- **Focus**: Transportation and mobility consulting
- **Clients**: Whoosh, Swyft Cities
- **Location**: South Florida
- **Services**: Retail mobility solutions, transit planning, stakeholder coordination

This suggests either:
1. Domain ownership has changed
2. Language exchange platform uses different domain
3. Subdomain configuration for the application
4. Development vs. production domain separation
