## What Works Out of the Box

✅ **One-on-one calls** - Just two users talking  
✅ **Video/audio controls** - Mute and camera toggle  
✅ **Call duration** - Timer showing how long you've been talking  
✅ **Incoming call notifications** - See who's calling  
✅ **Mobile responsive** - Works on phone and desktop  
✅ **Peer-to-peer** - Video goes directly between users, not through server  
✅ **Security** - Only friends can call each other  

---

## How Users Will Use It

1. User opens Mivton
2. Goes to Friends section
3. Sees all friends with **camera icon** next to each
4. Clicks camera icon on a friend
5. Sees "Calling..." modal
6. Friend gets notified "X is calling you"
7. Friend clicks Accept
8. Both see live video in full screen
9. Can mute/toggle camera
10. Click End Call to hang up
