🚨 **URGENT FIX NEEDED - Auto-Accept Issue**

The friend request is being auto-accepted because there might be some debug code or event handling issues. Here's what we need to fix:

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

1. **Deploy current changes** (the confirmation dialog is now added)
2. **Test the confirmation popup**
3. **If still auto-accepting, check browser console for:**
   - Multiple event listeners being attached
   - Automatic button clicks
   - JavaScript errors

## 📋 **What We've Fixed:**

✅ **Added proper confirmation dialog** - Users must confirm before accepting
✅ **Enhanced acceptFriendRequest function** - Now shows user name in confirmation
✅ **Removed auto-click test code** - No more automatic button clicking
✅ **Added animation** - Smooth removal of accepted requests

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Send a friend request** from Leo to Silviu
2. **Go to Requests tab** as Silviu  
3. **Click Accept** button
4. **Should see popup**: "Are you sure you want to accept the friend request from Leo?"
5. **Choose "✅ Yes, Accept"** or "❌ Cancel"
6. **Only accepts if user confirms**

## 🔍 **If Still Auto-Accepting:**

Check browser console for:
```
🚀 Accept friend request triggered for: [ID]
💬 Showing confirmation dialog: Are you sure...
💬 User selected: Confirm/Cancel
```

If you see the dialog being triggered but not shown, there might be a JavaScript conflict.

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy and Test**

The confirmation system should now prevent automatic acceptance. Users will always see a popup asking for confirmation before any friend request is accepted.

Let me know if you still see auto-acceptance after deployment!
