# Notification Badge Bug Fix

## Problem Identified
The notification bell shows "2" notifications pending even after marking all as read.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The application has TWO notification systems:
   - Phase 3.1: `/api/social-notifications` (older system)
   - Phase 3.2: `/api/notifications` (newer system)

2. The dashboard.js is inconsistently calling different endpoints
3. The notification badge count isn't properly synced with the mark-as-read functionality

## Solution Implementation
1. Standardize on Phase 3.2 notification system (`/api/notifications`)
2. Fix the notification badge update logic
3. Ensure proper real-time synchronization

## Files to be Fixed
1. `public/js/dashboard.js` - notification loading and badge management
2. `public/js/notification-center.js` - notification center UI
3. Ensure consistent API endpoint usage
